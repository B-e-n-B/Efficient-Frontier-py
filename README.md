**BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EFFICIENT FRONTIER**

The efficient frontier, a cornerstone of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), is a concept in finance that identifies the optimal balance between risk and return for a portfolio.
It represents a set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of return. 
Portfolios lying on the efficient frontier are considered efficient because they provide the best possible return for the amount of risk taken, as outlined by Harry Markowitz's MPT.
